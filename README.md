# Data Wrangling Udacity Project
In partial fulfilment of my Data Analyst Nanodegree Course at Udacity, I did this project in order to practice what I learnt in the data wrangling section of the course. The dataset that is wrangled is the famous Twitter archive of user @dog_rates tweets, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is an account which rates people's dogs with an humorous comment about the dog on Twitter. Majority o these ratings usually have a denominator of 10.
